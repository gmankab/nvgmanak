### docs

this nvim config has lot of dependencies, so better way is to use this all inside distrobox, and not shit in your system

if you want to install this on you main system outside of distrobox, just skip first "configuring distrobox" paragraph, everything would work exactly same

my host system is fedora silverblue, and i use this neovim config with arch distrobox container

it's recommended to use arch distrobox, no matter what host system you have

the reason is that arch maintainers are packaging neovide, and you can install neovide from arch repos

on fedora there are three copr repos with neovide, but all mainteiners abandoned it, so in the guide for fedora distrobox we just downloading neovide from github releases
